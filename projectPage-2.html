				<p class="bodyText">In the summer of 2018, I took a semester off school to do a self started design bootcamp where I would complete projects and then take them to industry professionals for feedback. The second project I completed was creating a web app from scratch that would allow musicians to create a sonic moodboard. </p>

				<p class="bodyText">Early on, I realized that with this project, I was putting my hand in so many different pots. It was starting to become overwhelming and I lacked a clear direction. So I created a list of design principles to help focus on what the product stood for, in turn, helping me make decisions.</p>

This means while they should be given a lot of freedom, they should not have to think hard about decisions not relating to making music (ex. design decisions).</p>

				<p class="bodyText">So I decided to go through a sketching method where I would break the app in to components, and get some of my wildest ideas down on paper. After each round of this I would use blue and red pen to point out things I liked and didn’t like about my designs, iterating until I felt like I got it right.</p>

				<h1 class="sectionTitle centered">Conclusion</h1>
					<div class="margin-30"></div>
				<p class="bodyText">Upon doing this project I took a trip to New York to get feedback from designers on how this product would live in the real world. We talked about the strengths of the product itself, product strategy, and the potential of where this product could go. I came out of those meetings really inspired to turn this product in to a startup. However, I wanted to get some real world experience first, so I decided to intern at some music tech startups <a class="inTextLink" href="https://splice.com/home">Splice</a>, and <a class="inTextLink" href="https://treble.is/discover">Treble</a></p>
